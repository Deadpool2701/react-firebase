This is a secure messaging app where your messages are protected by a 2-layer image encryption, this means that if a 3rd Party intercepts your chats they'll just see some random images in which the actual message will be hidden.
This is just the first version with basic features but I'll try to update and add more features in time.

Hope you enjoy using it and feel free to contact me regarding any doubts or questions you might have on deadpool012002@gmail.com
